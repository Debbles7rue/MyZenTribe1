          At MyZenTribe, we believe connection, community, and kindness should never be
          overshadowed by distractions or profit-driven agendas. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve built this
          platform with a clear commitment to our members:

          <h2 className="mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">1. No Ads. Ever.</h2>
          <p className="opacity-85">
            You will never see invasive banner ads, pop-ups, or unrelated product pitches here.
            Your experience on MyZenTribe will remain peaceful, focused, and free from noise.

          <h2 className="mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">2. Transparent Funding</h2>
          <p className="opacity-85">
            We are funded through voluntary donations and, in the future, a simple and affordable
            membership model. Until January 1, 2026, MyZenTribe is completely free for everyone.
            After that, youâ€™ll have the option to join with a membership plan â€” or continue
            supporting through donations if you wish.

          <p className="opacity-85">
            Our decisions, features, and updates are shaped with you in mind. We welcome feedback
            and actively listen to our members to make this a space that truly serves spiritual,
            wellness, and community-focused individuals.

            Through features like Karma Corner, community events, and opportunities for members to
            showcase their skills and services, we aim to create ripples of kindness that reach far
            beyond the screen.
