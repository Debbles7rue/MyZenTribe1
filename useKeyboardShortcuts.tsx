The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis
The build failure is due to a module not found error in the file `./app/(protected)/calendar/page.tsx`.

The specific error message is: 
```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@/hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts'
```

### Solution
1. Verify that the package or file `'@/hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts'` is included in the `package.json` of the project or was committed to the repository.
2. If `'@/hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts'` is a local file, ensure it exists at the specified path relative to the file `./app/(protected)/calendar/page.tsx`.
3. If the file exists, ensure that the path `'@/hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts'` is correctly imported in the file `./app/(protected)/calendar/page.tsx`.

By addressing the missing module and ensuring its correct inclusion or existence at the specified path, the build should be able to resolve the module successfully.
